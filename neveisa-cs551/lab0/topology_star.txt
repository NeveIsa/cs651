# The graph is undirected (i.e. if you set a link from 1 to 2 no need to write 2 to 1).
# Each line is a link between two switches. Each switch id must be an integer.
# The name of this file must be "topology.txt"
# One host is automatically connected to each switch.

# This is a star topology with 4 spokes
1 2
1 3

# Topology with loop.
# This is the topology shown in Figure 2 of the assignment.
# Should be used to answer questions.
